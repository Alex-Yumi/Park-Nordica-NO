When purchasing tickets, you can sign up for one of the feeding times to experience the animals up close and enjoy first encounters in the new park.\n\nPlease note: The number of visitors is strictly limited per day, as the park is still under construction and will only be partially opened.\n\nAdditionally, we invite you to enjoy hearty grilled snacks and non-alcoholic refreshments. Each ticket includes one food voucher and one drink voucher that can be redeemed on site.\n\nWe are particularly looking forward to welcoming guests from the Namdalen region, from Trøndelag, and beyond for this unique opportunity – to give you a first taste of the new Park Nordica experience.\n\nTickets are available now – while supplies last!",
